profile.office.description: After a common Master Thesis in 2008 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Nathanaël Chollet and Yann Gramegna worked separately for about six years for different renowned architecture offices in Basel and Zürich. During these years they worked on studies and on the construction of complex projects, acquiring therefore a precious experience. In 2015, they found together NYX architectes in Zürich. 

profile.approach: Approach
profile.approach.description: NYX architectes is active and skilled in every architecture field and in every project phase. From the very large scale, the urban visions, to the smaller scale, the execution of daily architectural objects passing by the production of images, the office approaches every project in a pragmatic way and questions the context, the program and the involved actor in order to generate, for each situation, a clear and specific project.
